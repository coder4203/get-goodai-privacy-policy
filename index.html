2. Collecting and Using Your Personal Data
2.1 Types of Data Collected
Personal Data
We may collect the following information:
Account Information – Email address and authentication credentials for login or sign-in.
Profile Details – Display name, age range, gender, or fitness goals (if voluntarily provided).
Fitness and Performance Data – Workouts, measurements, or progress data you manually record.
Communication Data – Messages or feedback you send through in-app forms or email.
Usage Data
Collected automatically when you interact with the App. This may include:
Device type, operating-system version, and unique identifiers.
App interaction metrics (screen views, session duration, button taps).
Crash logs, error diagnostics, and performance data.
Approximate location data (city or region) for analytic purposes.
Exercise Data
When you log or track workouts, we store those entries securely under your account so that you can review progress, view analytics, and receive insights.
Payment Data
Payments for subscriptions or upgrades are processed exclusively through official app-store billing systems (such as Apple App Store or Google Play Billing).
We do not collect or store your credit-card or banking details. Only anonymized transaction confirmations (e.g., subscription status) are stored to verify premium access.
3. Use of Your Personal Data
We may use your Personal Data to:
Operate and maintain the App’s features and functionality.
Authenticate users and manage secure account access.
Provide personalized recommendations based on your fitness data and goals.
Send administrative communications, including security alerts, policy updates, or account-related messages.
Analyze user behavior and technical performance to enhance reliability and design.
Enforce our Terms and Conditions and protect against misuse.
Comply with legal obligations and regulatory requirements.
We never sell or rent your Personal Data to third parties.
4. Retention of Your Personal Data
We retain your Personal Data only for as long as needed to:
Maintain your account, provide requested services, and meet legal obligations.
Resolve disputes, troubleshoot issues, and enforce agreements.
When data is no longer required, it is securely deleted or anonymized. Backup copies may persist temporarily for system integrity or legal compliance.
5. Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your information may be processed and stored on servers located in other regions or countries.
We take reasonable steps to ensure that transfers occur under strong protection standards, such as encryption, secure transport protocols (HTTPS/TLS), and restricted access controls.
By using the App, you consent to such transfers consistent with this Policy.
6. Delete Your Personal Data
You can delete your account and all associated data directly within the App at any time by tapping the “Delete Account” option in your profile or settings menu.
When you confirm deletion:
Your account and all stored data — including workout history, progress logs, and personal details — are permanently erased from our active systems.
Certain minimal records (for example, transaction confirmations required by app-store billing systems or legal compliance) may be retained securely for a limited period before automatic removal.
Once deletion is complete, your data cannot be recovered, even if you reinstall or sign up again using the same email address.
If you experience any issues using the in-app deletion feature, you may also contact (notyet)  for manual verification and removal.
7. Disclosure of Your Personal Data
Business Transactions
In the event of a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or asset sale, your Personal Data may be transferred as part of that process. You will be notified before any material changes occur.
Law Enforcement
We may disclose your information when legally required to respond to a court order, subpoena, or lawful government request.
Other Legal Requirements
We may also share information in good faith when necessary to:
Fulfill legal or contractual obligations.
Protect and defend our rights, intellectual property, or safety.
Investigate potential violations, fraud, or security incidents.
Protect users or the public from harm.
8. Security of Your Personal Data
We employ technical and organizational safeguards, including:
Secure encryption during transmission and storage.
Authentication checks and limited-access credentials for internal systems.
Regular security testing and monitoring.
Despite these precautions, no digital platform can guarantee absolute security. Use the App with an understanding of these inherent limitations.
9. Children’s Privacy
Our App is not intended for individuals under 13 years of age (or the minimum digital-consent age in your jurisdiction).
We do not knowingly collect or store information from children. If you believe a child has submitted data, please contact us for prompt removal.
10. Links to Other Websites
The App may contain links, redirects, or integrations that connect to external platforms.
We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of those external services. We encourage you to review their privacy policies before interacting with them.
11. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may revise this Privacy Policy periodically. Updates will be posted within the App, with the “Last Updated” date reflecting the latest revision.
Continued use of the App after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
